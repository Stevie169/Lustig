      <p id="Content">Victor Lustig, whose real name is still debated, is known by many as <strong>the smoothest conman to have ever lived</strong> - for good reason! He is known to have conned 5000$ from the formidable Al Capone, and to have tried to sell the Eiffel Tower twice. His lesser-known acts include selling his selling of Rumanian Boxes, and scamming the money of hopeful investors. His life was quite short, having only lived to the age of 57, dying in a prison in his late life after being caught for his crimes. In his late prison years, he wrote a set of instructions called the "Ten Commandments for Con Men," which is followed by many con artists to this day!</p>
      <h2 id="BigHeading">Notorious Scams by Lustig</h2>
      <h3 id="SmallHeading">Conning Al Capone</h3>
        <p id="Content">During the Great Depression, Lustig carried out an extremely risky scam against Al Capone, knowing that he would not make it out alive if Capone knew he was being scammed. Lustig's scam was not straight-forward, instead very indirect. He asked if Capone would give him 50,000$ into a crooked scheme of his. He then stored this 50,000$ into a safe for two months, having done nothing with the money. He returned to Capone with his 50,000$ saying the scheme had failed, and was there to return the money to Capone. He then lied, saying he had lost all means of supporting his livinghood by gathering 50,000$ for Capone, and pleaded Capone for some pity in the form of cash. In this way, Capone gave him 5,000$; thus, Lustig had successfully conned Al Capone.</p>
      <h3 id="SmallHeading">Selling of the Eiffel Tower</h3>
        <p id="Content">While Lustig was in France, in 1925, he read about the Eiffel Tower and troubles with its maintenance. He learned about the public's growing opinion for it to be scrapped, since repair and maintenance would be expensive. In this way, he invited a small group of wealthy scrap metal dealers, and acted as if he was a government official negotiating for the scrapping of the Eiffel Tower. His etiquette and knowledge of the Eiffel Tower convinced a dealer called Poisson. He was not successful the second time he tried to enact this scam.</p>
      <h3 id="SmallHeading">The Rumanian Box Scam</h3>
        <p id="Content">One of Victor's most successful low-key scams is his selling of "Rumanian Boxes." He claimed that these boxes could duplicate paper money, and designed a clever box that seemed to the average person to have duplicated paper bills perfectly over 6 hours. Seeing this, individuals would ask for the sale of this box, but Lustig would act like the box was not for sale until the individual offered a high price, to which Lustig 'reluctantly' agreed and sold the box.</p>
      <h2 id="BigHeading">Victor Lustig's "Ten Commandments for Con Men"</h2>
      <ol id="TenCom">
        <li>Be a patient listener</li>
        <li>Never look bored</li>
        <li>Wait for the other person to reveal any political opinions, then agree with them</li>
        <li>Let the other person reveal religious views, then have the same ones</li>
        <li>Hint at sex talk, but don't follow it up unless the other person shows a strong interest</li>
        <li>Never discuss illness, unless some special concern is shown</li>
        <li>Never pry into a person's personal circumstances</li>
        <li>Never boast â€“ just let your importance be quietly obvious</li>
        <li>Never be untidy</li>
        <li>Never get drunk</li>
